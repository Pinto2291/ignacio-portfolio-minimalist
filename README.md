# **Ignacio Portfolio**

This is my personal portfolio where I use my frontend skills with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and multiple libraries like *jQuery* to create a site that represent who I am and what I do.

I'm a Civil Engineer, Front End developer, remote worker, customer service agent, data entry agent and a hard worker always wanting to learn and develop new skills

I also have experience using AI systems like Bard and perplexity
